    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix marinade – For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a
        ziplock bag. A bag works best because the chicken remains nicely coated
        in the marinade. If you prefer to use a container, either turn the
        chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air, then
        massage to coat from the outside. Leave to marinade for 12 to 24 hours
      </li>
      <li>
        Yogurt sauce – Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients
        then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the flavours meld. This
        will keep for 3 days in the fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great
        crust on it from the spices, and you will adore the smell. It’s
        intoxicating!
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices
        to redistribute throughout the flesh, else they will just run out
        everywhere when you slice the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make their
        own wraps! The chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce and
        warmed flatbreads – homemade or store bought. If the chicken is on the
        larger side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are smaller, I tend to
        just leave them whole.
